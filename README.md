# Advanced Data Engineering Bootcamp

This repo was created to store the code produced during [How Bootcamps' Advanced Data Engineering Bootcamp](https://learn.howedu.com.br/turma/engenharia-de-dados/online). This bootcamp covers [Infrastructure as Code (IaC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code), especifically for [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)'s [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) and [CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/).

## Welcome to your CDK Python project

This is a blank project for Python development with CDK.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

This project is set up like a standard Python project.  The initialization
process also creates a virtualenv within this project, stored under the `.venv`
directory.  To create the virtualenv it assumes that there is a `python3`
(or `python` for Windows) executable in your path with access to the `venv`
package. If for any reason the automatic creation of the virtualenv fails,
you can create the virtualenv manually.

To manually create a virtualenv on MacOS and Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

After the init process completes and the virtualenv is created, you can use the following
step to activate your virtualenv.

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

If you are a Windows platform, you would activate the virtualenv like this:

```bash
source .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Once the virtualenv is activated, you can install the required dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

At this point you can now synthesize the CloudFormation template for this code.

```bash
cdk synth
```

To add additional dependencies, for example other CDK libraries, just add
them to your `setup.py` file and rerun the `pip install -r requirements.txt`
command.

## Useful commands

* `cdk ls`          list all stacks in the app
* `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
* `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
* `cdk docs`        open CDK documentation

Enjoy!
